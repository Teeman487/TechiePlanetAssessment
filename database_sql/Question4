SELECT userId, AVG(duration) AS averageDuration FROM sessions
GROUP BY userID having COUNT(*) > 1;

Explanation:

AVG(duration) calculates the average session duration for each user.
GROUP BY userId groups all sessions by each user.
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ensures only users with more than one session are returned
