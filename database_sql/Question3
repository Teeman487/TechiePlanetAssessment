1. LEFT JOIN (games LEFT JOIN city)

SELECT g.yr, g.city, c.country
FROM games g
LEFT JOIN city c
    ON g.city = c.name;

| yr   | city    | country |
| ---- | ------- | ------- |
| 2004 | Athens  | Greece  |
| 2008 | Beijing | China   |
| 2012 | London  | UK      |
| 2032 | NULL    | NULL    |


Explanation (LEFT JOIN):

Get all (cities) and their latest (games) even
if some (cities) are not yet assigned a game


Returns everything from the left table (games).
Matching rows from the RIGHT table (city)
If no match is found, RIGHT table fields become NULL

2032 has no city → no match in city table → return NULL.



2. RIGHT JOIN

SELECT g.yr, g.city, c.name AS city_name, c.country
FROM games g
RIGHT JOIN city c
    ON g.city = c.name;

| yr   | city    | city_name | country   |
| ---- | ------- | --------- | --------- |
| 2004 | Athens  | Athens    | Greece    |
| 2008 | Beijing | Beijing   | China     |
| 2012 | London  | London    | UK        |
| 2032 | London  | London    | UK        |
| NULL | NULL    | Sydney    | Australia |





Explanation (RIGHT JOIN)
Used when secondary table(city) is the focus

Get all (games) and their (cities) even
if some games are not yet assigned to a city

Returns everything from the right table (city).
Missing matches in the left table show NULL.

Every city in the city table appears except Sydney (no matching games city),
so Sydney will show NULL for year.
