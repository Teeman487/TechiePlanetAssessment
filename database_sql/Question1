Given salaries:
A = 100, B = 80, C = 100
→ Second highest = 80.

Correct Answers:
✔ 1.
SELECT DISTINCT(salary) FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

Explanation:
It orders distinct salaries descending: 100, 80 → OFFSET 1 → 80.

✔ 2.
SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp);

Explanation:
MAX(salary) = 100
This query finds the max salary less than 100 → 80.

✔ 3.
SELECT salary FROM (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;


Explanation:
Inner query: 100, 80
Outer query picks the smallest → 80.



✖ Incorrect Answers:
✖ 4.
SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM (SELECT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;


Explanation:

Inner query returns salaries: 100, 100 (not DISTINCT)
After DISTINCT → 100, 100 → becomes 100
Ordering → 100
LIMIT 1 picks 100, which is wrong (should be 80).

✖ 5.
SELECT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;


Explanation.

Ordering with duplicates:

100
100
80

OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1 → gives 100, not 80.
